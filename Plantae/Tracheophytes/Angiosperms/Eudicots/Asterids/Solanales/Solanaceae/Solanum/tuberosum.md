## Nutrition
> Boiled potato pulp with skin is 77% water, 20% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat. In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), boiled potato supplies 87 calories of food energy, and is a rich source of vitamin B6 (23% of the Daily Value, DV), with moderate contents (10–16% DV) of some B vitamins and vitamin C. Other micronutrients are below 10% of the DV.
> 
> The potato is rarely eaten raw because raw potato starch is poorly digested by humans.
> 
> Potatoes are often broadly classified as having a high glycemic index (GI) and so are often excluded from the diets of individuals trying to follow a low-GI diet. The GI of potatoes can vary considerably depending on the cultivar, growing conditions and storage, preparation methods (by cooking method, whether it is eaten hot or cold, whether it is mashed or cubed or consumed whole), and accompanying foods consumed (especially the addition of various high-fat or high-protein toppings). Consuming reheated or pre-cooked and cooled potatoes may yield a lower GI effect due to the formation of resistant starch.

Toxicity:
> Exposure to light, physical damage, and age increase glycoalkaloid content within the tuber. Cooking at high temperatures—over 170 °C (338 °F)—partly destroys these compounds. The concentration of glycoalkaloids in S. jamesii (a wild potato) is sufficient to produce toxic effects in humans. Glycoalkaloid poisoning may cause headaches, diarrhea, cramps, and, in severe cases, coma and death. However, poisoning from cultivated potato varieties is very rare. Light exposure causes greening from chlorophyll synthesis, giving a visual clue as to which areas of the tuber may have become more toxic. However, this does not provide a definitive guide, as greening and glycoalkaloid accumulation can occur independently of each other.

冷冻薯条：
- Lamb Weston
  - 存储不便。因为裹了粉，冷冻时会粘连在一起，导致解冻缓慢，难以分离开以进行油炸。
