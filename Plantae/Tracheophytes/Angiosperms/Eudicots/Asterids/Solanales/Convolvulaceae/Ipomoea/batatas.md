[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato)

Also known as **sweet potato**.

> Although darker sweet potatoes are often referred to as "yams" in parts of North America, the species is not a [true yam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(vegetable)), which are [monocots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocots) in the order [Dioscoreales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscoreales).

> Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato cultivars with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.
