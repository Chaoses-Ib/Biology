# Gallus (Junglefowl)
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl)

> Junglefowl are the only four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the bird order Galliformes, and occur in parts of South and Southeast Asia.
> 
> One of the species in this genus, the red junglefowl, is of historical importance as the direct ancestor of the domestic chicken, although the grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl are likely to have also been involved.
