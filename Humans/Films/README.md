> The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between British and American English. In British usage, the name of the medium is `film`. The word `movie` is understood but seldom used. Additionally, `the pictures` (plural) is used somewhat frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited; in American English this may be called `the movies`, but that term is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a `cinema` or `movie theatre`.

> By contrast, in the United States, `movie` is the predominant term for the medium. Although the words `film` and `movie` are sometimes used interchangeably, `film` is more often used when considering artistic, theoretical, or technical aspects. The term `movies` more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled *How to Understand a Film* would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled *Let's Go to the Movies* would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and blockbusters.
