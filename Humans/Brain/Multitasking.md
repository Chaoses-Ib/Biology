# Multitasking
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking)

> Human multitasking is the concept that one can split their attention on more than one task or activity at the same time, such as speaking on the phone while driving a car.

Multitasking is hard.

> Multitasking can result in time wasted due to human context switching (e.g., determining which step is next in the task just switched to) and becoming prone to errors due to insufficient attention. Some people may be proficient at the tasks in question and also be able to rapidly shift attention between the tasks, and therefore perform the tasks well; however, self-perception of being good at multitasking or getting more done while multitasking is frequently inaccurate.

> Multitasking is mentally and physically stressful for everyone, to the point that multitasking is used in laboratory experiments to study stressful environments. Research suggests that people who are multitasking in a learning environment are worse at learning new information compared to those who do not have their attention divided among different tasks.

## Offloading
同样的 multitask，使用多台 monitor 会比使用一台 monitor 的认知负担更低。当使用物理工具进行工作时，更大的桌面也有助于降低认知负担。

人类会本能地使用物理世界来编码工作记忆，实现 offload，降低 context switch 开销。就像在计算机中使用 cache/RAM/swap 来保存进程信息一样。

计算机通过 multitasking 实现了在单台计算机上执行许多任务，给予了人类一种这样就足够进行任意 multitask 的幻觉，但这对人类并不是性能最高的方案，多台 monitor/计算机才是。switch 永远都有开销，离人类的原始心智模型/输入越远的 switch 开销就越大。

> To determine the true value of multiple monitors (real or virtual) we must understand their capabilities and integration with human cognitive and perceptual abilities, then design for their ultimate use. In the first experiment, we found that accessing information distributed across an array of monitors was at least as effective as locating and managing windows on a single monitor. In the second experiment, we found that a task that requires only infrequent monitoring can be moved to a secondary, peripheral monitor without disrupting performance on that or any other concurrent task.[^st]

> Results showed that participants who used the computer with two monitors performed the task set faster and with less workload, and they also expressed a subjective preference for the multiple monitor computer.[^kangLightweightTaskApplication2008]

> Results indicated that those who used the multi-monitor display were more inclined to multitask and scored higher on performance measures than those using the single monitor.

> There is a statistically significant relationship between experimental condition and time spent multitasking, where users of the quad-panel display system multitasked more frequently than users of the single panel display; this is also supported by qualitative analysis of user feedback.
> 
> The results of this study suggested that multiple monitor systems benefited users through **peripheral awareness** (Czerwinski et al., 2003). This was supported by user comments as well as qualitative observations. Users from the single monitor group complained about the discomfort of switching between too many windows, and users from the quad-panel group frequently expressed satisfaction at not having the need to switch between windows. By keeping all relevant information on the monitors, multiple monitor users are able to access and find relevant information more easily and accurately, thus increase the accuracy of there task performance.

> Although multiple monitors facilitate multi-tasking, there is no significant difference in task completion time between the multiple monitor group and single monitor group. Multiple monitors are partitioned by bezels, which allow the users the divide their tasks and multi-task on multiple monitors, thus, promote multi-tasking. On one hand, the results of this study validate statements from prior research (e.g., Grudin, 2001) that bezels promote task diversity, thus enabling multi-tasking. On the other hand, they also provide evidence that multi-tasking does not necessary leads to increased productivity. As indicated by the participants in the open-ended questions, multiple monitors sometimes can distract them from their primary tasks as they are trying too many things at once. This is in line with prior literature which suggest that multiple tasking is negatively associated with user performance as multitasking increases users’ cognitive burdens with the challenges of remembering and switching between multiple tasks.

> By far the most commented flaw, however, was not in the operating system or in any specific software, but in the quad-panel setup itself. Participants often didn’t like aspects of the 2 x 2 monitor arrangement. This arrangement puts the largest bezel area, where the four corners meet, directly in the center of the desktop space, which participants found uncomfortable. They also didn’t like the fact that there was no ‘primary’ screen, and since there was no central screen at eye level, users had to always be looking up and down, as well as left and right. In fact, **it was commonly observed that multiple monitor users arranged their windows so that there was only vertical scanning, or only horizontal scanning, but not both, only utilizing two of the four screens**. Some users also indicated that four screens of information were more than they wanted to handle at once.[^truemperUsabilityMultipleMonitor2008]

> Participants using dual monitors reported lower unnecessary cognitive load than participants using one monitor.[^millerDualComputerDisplays2020]
