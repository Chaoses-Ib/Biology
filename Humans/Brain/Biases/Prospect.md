# Prospect Theory
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory)

> Prospect theory is a theory of behavioral economics, judgment and decision making that was developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. The theory was cited in the decision to award Kahneman the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

> Based on results from controlled studies, it describes how individuals assess their loss and gain perspectives in an asymmetric manner (see [loss aversion](#loss-aversion)). For example, for some individuals, the pain from losing $1,000 could only be compensated by the pleasure of earning $2,000. Thus, contrary to the expected utility theory (which models the decision that perfectly rational agents would make), prospect theory aims to describe the actual behavior of people.

## Loss aversion
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)

> In cognitive science and behavioral economics, loss aversion refers to a cognitive bias in which the same situation is perceived as worse if it is framed as a loss, rather than a gain.

> Loss aversion was first proposed as an explanation for the endowment effect—the fact that people place a higher value on a good that they own than on an identical good that they do not own—by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990). Loss aversion and the endowment effect lead to a violation of the Coase theorem—that "the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible".

> It should not be confused with risk aversion, which describes the rational behavior of valuing an uncertain outcome at less than its expected value.

Endowment effect, divestiture aversion, 禀赋效应, 厌恶剥夺

> In psychology and behavioral economics, the **endowment effect**, also known as **divestiture aversion**, is the finding that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it. The endowment theory can be defined as "an application of prospect theory positing that loss aversion associated with ownership explains observed exchange asymmetries."
