# Floaters
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater)

> Floaters or eye floaters are sometimes visible deposits (e.g., the shadows of tiny structures of protein or other cell debris projected onto the retina) within the eye's vitreous humour ("the vitreous"), which is normally transparent, or between the vitreous and retina.

## Causes
> The vitreous usually starts out transparent, but imperfections may gradually develop as one ages. The common type of floater, present in most people's eyes, is due to these [degenerative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerative_disease "Degenerative disease") changes of the vitreous. The [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception "Visual perception") of floaters, which may be annoying or problematic to some people, is known as **myodesopsia**, or, less commonly, as *myodaeopsia*, *myiodeopsia*, or *myiodesopsia*. It is not often treated, except in severe cases, where [vitrectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy "Vitrectomy") (surgery) and [laser vitreolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater#Laser_vitreolysis) may be effective.

> Floaters can occur when eyes age; in rare cases, floaters may be a sign of retinal detachment or a retinal tear.

## Treatment
> It is not often treated, except in severe cases, where [vitrectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy "Vitrectomy") (surgery) and [laser vitreolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater#Laser_vitreolysis) may be effective.

> While surgeries do exist to correct for severe cases of floaters, there are no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this vitreous deterioration. Floaters are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually become less bothersome as a person learns to ignore them. Looking up/down and left/right will cause the floaters to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement. If floaters significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, then one of the treatments below may be necessary.

> As of 2017, insufficient evidence is available to compare the safety and efficacy of surgical vitrectomy with laser vitreolysis for the treatment of floaters. A 2017 Cochrane Review did not find any relevant studies that compared the two treatments.
>
> Aggressive marketing campaigns have promoted the use of laser vitreolysis for the treatment of floaters. No strong evidence currently exists for the treatment of floaters with laser vitreolysis. The strongest available evidence comparing these two treatment modalities are retrospective case series.

> Enzymatic vitreolysis has been trialed to treat vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) and anomalous posterior vitreous detachment. Although the mechanism of action may have an effect on clinically significant floaters, as of March 2015 there are no clinical trials being undertaken to determine whether this may be a therapeutic alternative to either conservative management or vitrectomy.

> The VDM project aims to find an effective, low-risk treatment for floaters. So far, there have been studies using colloidal gold or indocyanine green (ICG) injected into the eye followed by a low-energy laser to target problematic floaters, and this has shown to be successful on vitreous opacities obtained during vitrectomy and in rabbits.
