## Plaque
> Plaque is a film of bacteria that coats your teeth if you don't brush them properly. It contributes to [gum disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gum-disease/) and [tooth decay](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tooth-decay/).
> 
> Tooth brushing stops plaque building up. Try to make sure you clean every surface of all your teeth.

## Tooth brushing
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_brushing)
- Gargle clean, fresh water a couple of times and rinse the toothbrush with water before brushing.

- A thorough tooth brushing once a day is sufficient for maintaining oral health, and that most dentists recommended patients brush twice a day in the hope that more frequent brushing would clean more areas of the mouth.

- Brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day for about 2 minutes to help keep your teeth and mouth healthy.

- When should I brush my teeth?
  
  Brush your teeth for about 2 minutes last thing before you go to bed and on 1 other occasion every day.

- Should I use an electric or manual toothbrush?

  Some people find it easier to clean their teeth thoroughly with an electric toothbrush.

- What should I look for in a toothbrush?

  For most adults, a toothbrush with a small head and a compact, angled arrangement of long and short round-end bristles is fine. Medium or soft bristles are best for most people.

  If you're using an electric brush, one with an oscillating or rotating head may work better than a manual toothbrush.

- What type of toothpaste should I use?

  It's important to use a toothpaste with the right concentration of fluoride.

  Children don't need to use special children's toothpaste. Children of all ages can use family toothpaste, as long as it contains 1,350 to 1,500ppm fluoride. Children aged 3 and under who don't have tooth decay can use a lower strength children's toothpaste, but make sure it contains at least 1,000ppm fluoride.

  > It is very important that caregivers supervise children's brushing to minimize swallowing of toothpaste.

- *Don't rinse with water straight after toothbrushing*

  After brushing, spit out any excess toothpaste. Don't rinse your mouth immediately after brushing, as it'll wash away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste. Rinsing dilutes it and reduces its preventative effects.

- Should I use mouthwash?

  Using a mouthwash that contains fluoride can help prevent tooth decay, but don't use mouthwash (even a fluoride one) straight after brushing your teeth or it'll wash away the concentrated fluoride in the toothpaste left on your teeth.
  
  Don't eat or drink for 30 minutes after using a fluoride mouthwash.

- How to use dental floss

  Flossing isn't just for dislodging food wedged between your teeth. Regular flossing may also reduce [gum disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gum-disease/) and [bad breath](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bad-breath/) by removing plaque that forms along the gum line. It's best to floss *before* brushing your teeth.

### Tooth brushing before meals
> One study found that brushing immediately after an acidic meal (such as diet soda or common breakfast foods like orange juice, coffee, citrus fruit, dried fruit, bread, or pastries) caused more damage to enamel and dentin compared to waiting 30 minutes. Brushing immediately after consuming acidic beverages should be avoided. It is better to brush before breakfast or dinner.
>
> In addition, brushing before breakfast eliminates overnight bacteria buildup, preventing them from thriving on sugary breakfast foods and producing enamel-damaging acids, while stimulating saliva production to neutralize acidity and reinforce teeth with essential minerals.
