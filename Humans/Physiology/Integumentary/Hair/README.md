- 電動剪髮器、鏡子、剪刀（平剪及牙剪各一）、毛巾
  - 不要用绒毛巾，会很难清理
- 但是，其實側面或底層**直接剃得太短會做成分離、起角、彈起等問題**，而且近年流行的髮型亦不是以剷青剃短為主，反而需要有一定長度，剪髮器的功用主要在於修剪整齊。
- 乾髮容易在剪時移位而剪出缺口，所以我們會先**均勻弄濕**頭髮，然後**將側面頭髮向前梳**，這時候，才從鏡子決定好自己哪些部分需要修剪。
- 上半部分最常見問題就是瀏海頭髮插眼、頂部扁塌、兩側表面頭髮太長。
- 會在最後修飾的瑕疵主要集中在下半部分，常見的瑕疵包括使用電剷時剃得深淺不平均、高低落差、外圍線條太實而不夠自然等。

## Shampoo
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo)

> Shampoo is typically used to remove the unwanted build-up of sebum (natural oils) in the hair without stripping out so much as to make hair unmanageable. Shampoo is generally made by combining a surfactant, most often sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, with a co-surfactant, most often cocamidopropyl betaine in water. The sulfate ingredient acts as a surfactant, trapping oils and other contaminants, similarly to soap.

> In the 1970s, ads featuring Farrah Fawcett and Christie Brinkley asserted that it was unhealthy not to shampoo several times a week. This mindset is reinforced by the greasy feeling of the scalp after a day or two of not shampooing. Using shampoo every day removes sebum, the oil produced by the scalp. This causes the sebaceous glands to produce oil at a higher rate, to compensate for what is lost during shampooing. According to Michelle Hanjani, a dermatologist at Columbia University, a gradual reduction in shampoo use will cause the sebum glands to produce at a slower rate, resulting in less grease in the scalp. Although this approach might seem unappealing to some individuals, many people try alternate shampooing techniques like baking soda and vinegar in order to avoid ingredients used in many shampoos that make hair greasy over time.

> Washing the hair is a lot like washing skin. Water can remove most visible dirt and debris, but might not eliminate odors or oily deposits. Shampoo helps water remove dirt, debris, and odors, such as smoke or sweat effectively.

> For most people, there is no medical need to shampoo at all, as rinsing with water can remove dirt and dandruff. However, some health conditions can benefit from regular shampooing.
> 
> People with parasitic infections of the scalp, particularly lice, may need to use special shampoos to get rid of the bugs. Scalp psoriasis may improve with the use of special shampoos, particularly tar products or medicated shampoos. People with specific skin and scalp conditions should discuss their ideal hair care regimen with a dermatologist.
>
> By contrast, some medical conditions may get worse with frequent washing. Daily shampooing can irritate eczema, very dry skin, and dandruff.

## Hair loss
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss)

> Treatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition, which can also include shaving one's head. Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil (or finasteride) and hair transplant surgery. Alopecia areata may be treated by steroid injections in the affected area, but these need to be frequently repeated to be effective. Hair loss is a common experience. Pattern hair loss by age 50 affects about half of men and a quarter of women. About 2% of people develop alopecia areata at some point in time.

[Medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_loss#Medications):
- "Treatment must be continued indefinitely. If the treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes."

- [Dutasteride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutasteride#Scalp_hair_loss_and_excessive_hair_growth)

  > Dutasteride is approved for the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia in South Korea and Japan at a dosage of 0.5 mg per day. Several studies have found it to induce hair regrowth in men more rapidly and to a greater extent than even the highest approved dosage of finasteride. The superior effectiveness of dutasteride relative to finasteride for this indication is because the inhibition of 5α-reductase and consequent reduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production within the hair follicles is more complete with dutasteride.

Would you rather use hair loss medications every day for the rest of your life, or just embrace baldness?
