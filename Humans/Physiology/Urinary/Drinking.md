# Drinking
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking)

The USDA recommends a daily intake of total water: not necessarily by drinking but by consumption of water contained in other beverages and foods. The recommended intake is **3.7 liters** per day for an adult male, and **2.7 liters** for an adult female.[^wiki] About 20% of daily fluid intake usually comes from food and the rest from drinks.[^mayoclinic] Therefore, the recommended daily fluid intake of drinking is 3 liters for male and 2.2 liters for female.

Your fluid intake is probably adequate if[^mayoclinic]:
- You rarely feel thirsty
- Your urine is colorless or light yellow
