[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game)

> The fighting game genre of video games involves combat between multiple characters, often (but not limited to) one-on-one battles. Fighting game combat often features mechanics such as blocking, grappling, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into "combos". Characters generally engage hand-to-hand combat, often with martial arts, but some may include weaponry. Battles are usually set in a fixed-size arena along a two-dimensional plane, where characters navigate the plane horizontally by walking or dashing, and vertically by jumping. Some games allow limited movement in 3D space, such as *[Tekken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken_(video_game) "Tekken (video game)")*, while some are set in fully three-dimensional environments without restricting characters' movement, such as [*Power Stone*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Stone_(video_game) "Power Stone (video game)") and [*Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto:_Ultimate_Ninja_Storm "Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm"); these are sometimes referred to as "3D arena" fighting games.
