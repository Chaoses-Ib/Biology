## Inheritance
现代人与野人有着天翻地覆的差别，这种差别是无法单纯从基因产生的，而是从每一代人的教育中，一点一滴积累出的。

人类的教育是 unreproducible 的，每一代人教育的结果都受前一代人影响，是前代所有人类教育的总和。即使科技不再变化，我们也无法知道用同样的信息和方法教育下一代人会得到怎样的结果。存在一种可能，每代人实际上都在朝某个方向极化，这种极化会毁灭人类但却没有人能预见，或者即使预见也无力改变。从这个角度来看，野人可以算作是人类的生命火种。

这与计算机的发展有一定的相似性。从手写机器码，到汇编器，到编译器，现代计算机的运作依赖于历史产物，不是从零构建起的。不过如果愿意的话，从零构建计算机还是成本可行的，但从零构建复杂得多的现代人类就几乎不可行了。

## Civilization
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization)

> Historically, a civilization has often been understood as a larger and "more advanced" culture, in implied contrast to smaller, supposedly less advanced cultures. In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of [nomadic pastoralists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic_pastoralist "Nomadic pastoralist"), [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic "Neolithic") societies, or [hunter-gatherers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer "Hunter-gatherer"); however, sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.

[What is the difference between a culture and a civilization? When should I use one or another? : r/AskAnthropology](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/8urubk/what_is_the_difference_between_a_culture_and_a/)
> Both terms have multiple definitions in different contexts and are used in informal ways that overlap considerably. But generally speaking a “civilization” refers to a society that has developed cities, that is large permanently inhabited settlements, in contrast to people who live nomadically such as hunter-gatherers and pastoralists. Culture on the other hand is universal. All humans everywhere have culture. However they live, in its entirety, that’s their culture.
